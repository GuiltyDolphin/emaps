#+TITLE: Emaps

* Introduction

Emaps provides utilities for working with keymaps and keybindings in Emacs.

* Features

** Defining keys

Emacs has a built-in ~define-key~ function, but this can only handle one binding
at a time, for example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(define-key keymap "a" 'fun-a)
(define-key keymap "b" 'fun-b)
(define-key keymap "c" 'fun-c)
; etc.
#+END_SRC

Emaps provides the ~emaps-define-key~ function that provides the same
functionality, but allows multiple keys to be defined at once, thus the
above becomes:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(emaps-define-key keymap
  "a" 'fun-a
  "b" 'fun-b
  "c" 'fun-c) ; etc.
#+END_SRC

** Viewing keymaps

Run ~M-x emaps-describe-keymap-bindings~ (recommended binding ~C-h K~) to
display the bindings for a given keymap (see below), ~emaps-describe-keymap~
can be used to view keymaps as variables (but with characters displayed instead
of integers, where possible).
